# Influence Platform White Paper

**January 17, 2018**

**Abstract:** The Influence Platform uses existing blockchain architecture to implement a token that commodifies social media influence. This is achieved by creating a marketplace in which the INF token is exchanged for social actions such as reposts, retweets, follows, etc. The platform provides functionality for running campaigns as well as targeting specific influencers. The resulting economy allows any individual to efficiently promote content or monetize their social media account.
